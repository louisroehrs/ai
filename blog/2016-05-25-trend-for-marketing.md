Our IBM Incubator team built the next big thing for Watson.

This video really shows how new technology will assist practioners to work more in depth with their information and accomplish more than they can today. The practioners will be able to tackle problems with alacrity that are just not being tackled today.
I do not see this type of technology as replacing humans with computers. Humans donâ€™t currently have the capability as the amount of data and processing required is already too much for current staffing levels to handle. What I see happening is that businesses that adopt and use this technology will grow and have the resources to bring in more people that generate the value unlocked in partnership with this technology.

Please, sit down and enjoy.
