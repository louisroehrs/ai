**What would happen if I chained two AIs together to work as a team?**

ChatGPT is a conversationAI at chat.openai.com that can generate answers to questions or produce detailed descriptions given minimal input. DALL-E 2 creates art from elaborate textual descriptions.

So I asked ChatGPT to:

<!-- truncate -->

> Describe a business scene with people collaborating on a piece of art.

It responded with:

> In a bustling art studio, a team of talented artists are collaborating on a large-scale piece of art. They are all working together, sharing ideas and techniques, and using their individual strengths to bring the piece to life. Some are sketching out rough drafts and ideas on paper, while others are working on the more technical aspects of the piece, such as adding color or texture. There is a sense of excitement and creativity in the air, as the team works together to create something truly unique and beautiful. As the piece starts to take shape, the artists share their thoughts and feedback with each other, making tweaks and adjustments along the way to ensure that the final product is exactly what they envision. In the end, the team is able to create a stunning piece of art that they are all proud of, thanks to their collaboration and dedication to the project.

I pushed this output, at least what would fit, into DALL-E 2 and it generated a few options. You can be the judge of how well these images meet the original request. With DALL-E 2, you can ask for variations of each of the original images to continue exploring for the image that fits the bill. As to “business scene” in the original request, I think the third image below come closest, although I do find the appearance of the craftsman’s apron fascinating in the second image. The implications for the future are astounding for AI as a creative tool.
