The author, Luke Bilton at InPublishing, had some great suggestions for future releases of our IBM Watson Trend application

Some excerpts from his article follow.

 “IBM Watson Trend is an intriguing example of what automated content might look like in an app.
The app uses natural language processing and machine learning to intelligently analyse millions of conversations across social networks, blogs, forums, comments, ratings and reviews. These information sources are curated into a real-time buyers guide, forecasting the products which will be ‘hot’ and forecasting consumer interest.”
“It is a pleasing bundle of different content types which works well together as an editorial package.”
“It’s intriguing stuff. Now, if only I could connect Watson Trend (so I know what to buy) to my Google Calendar (so I don’t miss a birthday) and then to Amazon (so I don’t have to go to the shops)… I might automate my way to becoming the best dad in the world.”
