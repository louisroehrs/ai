**WINNING!!**

Last night at the 2016 Digital Analytics Association Excellence Awards Gala, the application my team built, IBM Watson Trend, received the Technology of the Year Award! This is a notable industry award â€“ especially given the competition, which included both top tier firms as well as innovative startups, such as Adobe and Ensighten.

What a fun night!  Especially the part where the head of Google Analytics hands us the award!


Edit: The Digital Analytics Association was consumed by the American Marketing Association.
