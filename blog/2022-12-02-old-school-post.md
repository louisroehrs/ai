**Lost your headphones?**

![Yes, this handset works!](/blogimg/louis-handset.jpeg)

I forgot my high-tech Bluetooth headphones and had to reach for this handset. The sound quality is actually amazing and there is a whole additional benefit. People (at least Gen-X and boomers…and my kids!) get that I’m actually on the phone and talking to someone not in the room. Sometimes, this old tech provides the ambient information to others that is lost in our continually connected, wireless world. Combine with this with the Lightning to 3.5 mm Audio dongle from Apple, and you can use this with your iPhone, too. It works really well, can leave your phone in the pocket and people will know you are on the phone, even while walking down the street.

Looking for your headphones, but they are too tiny to find? This big handset is much harder to lose under the bed, in the covers, or under the car seat.

If you are looking for that On-Air indicator or looking for a way to notify others and let them know you are on a call or on the phone, I highly recommend picking up one of these today!
