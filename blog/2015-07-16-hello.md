I work in IBM Watson Commerce Technical Strategy group. Recently I produced IBM Watson Trend and before that fathered [IBM Commerceâ€™s Universal Behavior Exchange](https://developer.goacoustic.com/acoustic-exchange/docs/acoustic-exchange-public-api-reference) that was sold to Acoustic.  I designed this product from vague pain points in the digital marketing world to create singular industry standard for moving behvavior information between 3,500 partners including Google Analytics and more.  Remember when the ads on the internet went from being totally irrelevant to being a little too scary accurate?  Acoustic Exchange is what happened....

It defined the dynamic event library providing a standard of marketing events all systems can agree on while allowing flexibility for new types of events.  Check out this amazing standards documentation of the [event taxonomy](https://exchange-us-1.goacoustic.com/#/taxonomy)
Now I am working on a whole new way of looking at Site Search.

I started my career at Apple Computer, Inc.

At Apple, we taught machines all about humans.

At IBM, I am helping teach machines how to learn and figure things out on their own.

In former lives, I have worked with many Silicon Valley startups consulting and employed including Apple Computer, WebTV, women.com, match.com, and DemandTec. All were either acquired or had market cap explosions.

Opinions expressed here are my own.
