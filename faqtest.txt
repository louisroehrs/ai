Question: What am I investing in?

Question: How is Roots different?
Answer: Roots differentiates itself by offering a unique model that benefits both investors and residents, with a focus on community and resident engagement through our 'Live In It Like You Own It' program, offering quarterly distributions and liquidity options. 'Live In It Like You Own It' Program:This program is a cornerstone of our community-focused approach. It allows residents to invest in the Roots fund, effectively giving them a stake in the property they live in from the day they move in. Additionally, residents are incentivized to maintain their homes by earning rebates on a quarterly basis. There are 3 require steps to earn your rebate. 1. Pay rent on time 2. Be a good neighbor 3. Submit a video walkthrough of the inside/outside of your unit every quarter. Having residents who take pride in their homes and are motivated to keep them well-maintained directly contributes to preserving and boosting the investment's value for all involved parties.

Question: What is a REIT?
Answer: A REIT, which stands for Real Estate Investment Trust, is a unique way to invest in real estatewithout the hassle of directly buying and managing properties yourself. Here are the key points:Easy to Get Started: You can purchase shares of a REIT, and in return, you become a shareholder with a stake in the properties owned by the REIT.Similar to a Stock: Just like you can invest money in a company by purchasing their stock, you can purchase shares of property through a REIT. This means that, in a similar fashion to stocks, you become a shareholder with a stake in the REIT's assets, making you a beneficiary of rental income and property appreciation.Distributions and Appreciation: REITs share the profits with investors through distributions (distributions). REITs must distribute 90% of their profits to shareholders in the form of distributions. You can choose to reinvest these distributions, further growing your ownership. As the property's value increases over time, your initial investment grows too.Property Acquisition and Leasing: The REIT's managers buy properties and lease them, handling rent collection and property care for you.
Question: How do you make money?
Answer: Making money through your investment in Roots occurs via two main channels: changes in unit price and quarterly distributions.Changes in Unit Price: Roots updates its unit price every quarter, which reflects the performance of the REIT and cam increase as the underlying properties appreciate in value. When the unit price increases, the value of your investment grows, meaning your units are worth more than when you initially purchased them. Quarterly Distributions: Roots distributes profits to its investors every quarter. These distributions come from the income generated by the properties within the Roots portfolio, such as rental income. Receiving quarterly distributions provides you with a regular income stream from your investment. Additionally, you have the option to reinvest these distributions back into the fund, which can buy more units and increase your ownership stake over time.Together, these mechanisms work to potentially increase your wealth both through the appreciation of your investment and through regular distributions. 
Question: Do you accept 1031 Exchanges?
Answer: At present, our focus at Roots is managing our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which does not qualify for 1031 exchanges. We specialize in providing investors with an opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, offering the benefits of real estate investment along with the liquidity of a stock-like investment.While we may not meet your specific need for a 1031 exchange eligible investment, we would be delighted to have you join our investor community. Investing in our REIT could be a great way to diversify your portfolio and participate in the real estate market without the typical constraints of property ownership.
Question: What are the fees associated with investing through my IRA?
Answer: Investing in Roots through a retirement account generally requires rolling over your existing retirement account to an authorized custodian. Fees vary by custodian; so it's important to find the custodian that best fits your needs and financial goals.
Question: Can I transfer my existing IRA to Roots?
Answer: To invest these funds from an IRA or 401k into alternative investments like real estate or REITs, the account must be held by an authorized custodian who is experienced in handling such investments. Rolling over to an authorized custodian helps ensure that your investments remain compliant with IRS rules, thereby protecting the tax benefits associated with these retirement accounts. Roots would be happy to recommend a custodian to you, but we more than happy to work with any custodian if you find one on your own.
Question: IRA process
Answer: The IRA rollover process allows you to transfer funds from one retirement account to another, such as from a traditional IRA to a self-directed IRA that can invest in alternative investments like Roots. This process is useful if you're looking to diversify your retirement portfolio with real estate investments through Roots. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to roll over your IRA into an account that can invest in Roots:1. Choose a Self-Directed IRA Custodian: Start by selecting a custodian that offers self-directed IRA services and allows investments in real estate or REITs like Roots. Directed Trust Company is one custodian that Roots has identified as reliable and capable of handling such investments, but you can choose any custodian that meets your needs.2. Open a New Self-Directed IRA Account: Once you've chosen a custodian, you'll need to open a new self-directed IRA account. This process typically involves completing an application with the custodian, which can often be done online.3. Initiate the Rollover: Contact the financial institution where your current IRA is held and request a direct rollover to your new self-directed IRA. A direct rollover involves transferring funds directly between institutions without you taking possession of the funds, which helps avoid potential taxes and penalties.4. Select Your Investment: With your self-directed IRA funded, you can now direct your custodian to invest those funds in Roots. This will require filling out investment authorization forms specifying how much you wish to invest.5. Complete the Investment: Your custodian will process the investment based on your instructions, purchasing units in Roots on behalf of your IRA.It's important to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before proceeding with an IRA rollover, especially if you're unfamiliar with self-directed IRAs or investing in alternative assets.

Question: 401k process
Answer: Investing in Roots through a 401(k) rollover involves moving funds from your existing 401(k) retirement account into an authorized custodian account that can then be invested in the Roots fund. This process allows you to potentially benefit from real estate investments within your retirement planning. Here's an overview of the steps involved:1. Establish an Eligible Account with an Authorized Custodian: First, you need to have an IRA or another eligible retirement account set up with a custodian that permits investments in real estate or alternative investments like Roots. Directed Trust Company is one example of a custodian that Roots has identified as reliable for handling such investments, given their experience and fair fee structure.2. Rollover Your 401(k): You will need to initiate a rollover of your funds from your current 401(k) account to your new custodian account. This typically involves filling out a rollover request form with your current 401(k) provider. It's important to specify that you want a "direct rollover," which moves your funds directly to the new custodian to avoid potential taxes and penalties.3. Select Roots as Your Investment: Once your funds are in your new IRA or eligible retirement account, you can choose to invest those funds in Roots. This will involve completing additional paperwork through your custodian to direct the investment.It's highly recommended to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before proceeding with a 401(k) rollover to invest in Roots. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, help you understand the implications of the rollover, and ensure that this investment strategy aligns with your long-term retirement goals.This process allows you to diversify your retirement portfolio by including real estate investments, potentially providing a balance to more traditional stocks and bonds.

Answer: At Roots, we can facilitate investments from individuals, IRAs, or established legal entities such as LLCs, Trusts, etc. This means that each investment account is associated with a single Social Security Number or Tax ID and consequently, only one Form W-9 can be issued per investor. As such, we are unable to accommodate joint or married accounts. While your spouse may not be a co-investor in the account, they can still be designated to inherit the investment in accordance with your estate planning or state law provisions.It's important to note that regardless of adding your spouse as a co-signer or co-owner to your account, the investment will still be treated as an individual asset in the court of law. This means that in terms of estate planning, this asset would follow the directives outlined in your last Will and Testament. In the unfortunate event of death without a Will, the asset will be distributed according to the laws of your state of residence. We recognize that this might be confusing, especially for married couples looking to invest together. However, this structure is in place to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to simplify the tax reporting process.We recommend consulting with a legal or financial advisor to explore the best options for including your Roots investment in your joint financial planning and estate considerations.

Answer: Roots is designed with flexibility to support various investment timelines, offering quarterly liquidity options, a feature that distinguishes it from many other real estate investments. This structure allows investors to request cash out of their investments every quarter, providing a level of liquidity not always available in real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, it's crucial to note that Roots imposes an early withdrawal fee for investors who choose to cash out within the first year of their investment. This fee is 6% of the amount being withdrawn early. Therefore, when planning your investment with Roots, it's important to consider your financial goals, need for liquidity, and investment strategy. Aligning your investment with your overall financial plan, while being mindful of the early withdrawal fee, will help in making informed decisions that suit your investment objectives.
Question: What are the benefits of being an accredited investor?
Answer: At Roots, the investment structure is designed to be inclusive and accessible to a broad range of investors, without distinguishing benefits based on accredited investor status. An accredited investor, as defined by securities regulations, is an individual or a business entity that is allowed to deal in securities that may not be registered with financial authorities. They are recognized as such based on their income, net worth, asset size, governance status, or professional experience.With Roots, all investors, regardless of their accreditation status, have access to the same investment opportunities, distributions, and growth potential within the fund. The primary difference accreditation makes is in the potential investment cap related to one's income or net worth.The only advantage for an accredited investor with Roots arises if you decide to invest an amount that exceeds 10% of your annual income or net worth. Securities regulations limit non-accredited investors in how much they can invest in certain securities, including offerings like Roots, based on these criteria. Accredited investors, by contrast, do not face these same limitations and can choose to invest more significantly if they wish.However, it's important for all investors, accredited or not, to consider their investment in the context of their broader financial picture, risk tolerance, and investment goals. While being accredited offers more flexibility in investment amounts, Roots aims to ensure that all investors have the opportunity to participate in real estate investment, irrespective of their accreditation status or the size of their investment.
Question:  How do I verify my accreditation?
Answer: Since Roots does not require investors to be accredited, there is no need for accreditation verification.
Question: Who can invest?
Answer: To invest with Roots, there are specific requirements that must be met, reflecting regulatory and tax considerations. One key aspect is the necessity to file taxes in the United States, which is tied to the issuance of a Form 1099-DIV for dividends and distributions received from your investment. This form is a critical part of your tax documentation, reporting the income you've earned through your investment in Roots. As such, to be eligible to invest with Roots, you must:Be a U.S. Citizen: Investment in Roots is currently available to U.S. citizens. This requirement ensures compliance with U.S. tax laws and regulations, as the company must report dividends and distributions to the IRS for tax purposes.Be at Least 18 Years Old: You must be of legal age, which is 18 in most jurisdictions within the U.S., to enter into a contract and make investment decisions independently.File Taxes in the U.S.: You need to have a tax filing obligation in the United States. This is because Roots is required to issue a Form 1099-DIV to report your dividend income to the IRS, and you must include this information when you file your annual tax returns.These requirements are in place to ensure that both Roots and its investors are in compliance with U.S. financial regulations and tax laws.

Question: What is a unit?
Answer: In the context of Roots, a "unit" refers to a share of ownership in the Roots Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). When you invest in Roots, you become a limited partner in the business, and you are issued units that represent your ownership stake. These units qualify you to participate in all distributions of profits generated by the company. This structure is akin to purchasing shares in a company through the stock market, but in this case, you're investing in real estate. The value of these units can change based on the performance of the underlying properties in the REIT's portfolio, and they play a critical role in how profits are distributed to investors​​.
Question: How are unit prices calculated?
Answer: At the end of each quarter the fund evaluates its current Net Asset Value (NAV). This calculation is simple. We take the market value of all of the properties plus all accounts receivable and all cash on hand. We then subtract any debts and liabilities. After this calculation is made, we take the total NAV and divide it by the amount of outstanding units to get the unit price for the next quarter.
Question: How are distributions amounts determined
Answer: Distribution amounts for Roots are determined based on the profits generated by Roots. By law, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to their shareholders, ensuring that investors share in the success of the REIT's operations. These distributions are made on a quarterly basis, providing a regular income stream to investors. This amount can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on the overall performance of the fund.
Question: What does is mean if my share price is down?
Answer: If the share price of your investment in Roots is down, it indicates that the market value of the units you hold in the REIT has decreased since your purchase. This reduction in unit price reflects a change in the valuation of the underlying properties within the REIT's portfolio or market perception of the REIT's future income potential. In the context of real estate investment trusts like Roots, the share price can be influenced by various factors, including changes in real estate market conditions, occupancy rates, rental income, operational costs, and broader economic trends. A decrease in share price does not necessarily impact the income (distributions) you might receive from the property's earnings but indicates a lower valuation of your investment at that specific time, which could affect the total return on your investment if you were to sell your units at the decreased price.
Question: What is the SEC?
Answer: The SEC, or Securities and Exchange Commission, is a U.S. government agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and protecting investors. It ensures that public companies provide transparent and fair information to investors, overseas securities transactions, and enforces securities laws to prevent fraud and market manipulation. The SEC plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the financial markets and facilitating capital formation. Roots, as a private Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), operates under the guidelines of Regulation A of the SEC, ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory requirements and providing investors with confidence in the transparency and governance of our operations​​.
Question: What is the strategy for finding residents?
Answer: Roots employs a leasing team that utilizes standard industry practices for finding residents, akin to what other companies do in the real estate sector. This approach includes various strategies such as online listings, marketing, and leveraging real estate platforms to attract potential residents. Our leasing team works diligently to ensure that our properties are filled with responsible and qualified residents, contributing to the overall success and stability of our investment model.
Question: What is the "Live In It Like You Own It" program?
Answer: The Roots "Live in It Like You Own It™" program invites Residents to treat the property as if it were their own. In exchange, the Residents have the opportunity to earn ownership in the Roots real estate fund and are awarded rental rebates for taking care of the property and fulfilling the partnership guidelines. Instead of paying a traditional security deposit that typically sits in landlord's accounts collecting dust, residents use those funds to enroll in the “Live in it like you own it” program, allowing their money to grow while they rent. Additionally, Roots residents can earn rental rebates every three months when they complete the following simple steps to the program1. Pay rent on time.2. Be a good neighbor, maintaining peace within your community.3. Submit a short video of the inside and outside of the unit every 3 months. 
Question: How long am I committed to the investment?
Answer: You are not locked into your investment with Roots for a predetermined period. Roots offers liquidity to its investors every quarter, allowing you the flexibility to request cash out of your investment. This provides a significant level of flexibility compared to many other investment opportunities, which might require longer commitment periods. After the first year of your investment, you can cash out without incurring any penalty. However, if you decide to withdraw your investment within the first year, a 6% early withdrawal fee is applied​​.
Question: Can you provide more details on the profit distribution process?
Answer: Roots strives to provide investors with regular returns on their investment in the form of quarterly distributions. These distributions are a share of the profits generated from our real estate portfolio, which includes rental income and profits generated from a sale. As a REIT, Roots is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its investors.
Question: I don't want to pay a fee
Answer: Unfortunately, we can't waive the fee. The $5 is used to pay our payment processor and to help us keep the lights on. The good news is if you hold your investment for a year that's the only fee you will ever have to pay at Roots!
