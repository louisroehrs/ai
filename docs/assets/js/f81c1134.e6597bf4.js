These strategies go beyond the basics, tapping into structure, context manipulation, and iterative refinement to get results that are razor-sharp or creatively explosive. Here\u2019s how to push the envelope with AI:\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\\n\\nEncourage the AI to reason step-by-step for complex problems, mimicking human problem-solving. This works great for logic, analysis, or hypotheticals:\\n* \u201cSolve this: If a car travels 60 mph for 2 hours, then 40 mph for 3 hours, what\u2019s the average speed? Show your reasoning.\u201d\\n* \u201cDesign a sustainable city. First, identify key challenges, then propose solutions, and finally explain trade-offs.\u201d\\n\\nBy asking for the process, you get transparency and can spot where to tweak.\\n\\n**Few-Shot Learning**\\n\\nGive the AI examples to mimic a style, format, or reasoning pattern. This primes it to replicate what you\u2019re after:\\n* \u201cWrite a haiku. Here\u2019s two examples: \u2018Silent moon glows soft / Shadows dance on still water / Night holds its breath tight\u2019 and \u2018Frost bites the green leaves / Wind whispers through bare branches / Time turns cold and slow.\u2019 Now you try.\u201d\\n* \u201cClassify these as positive or negative: \u2018Great job!\u2019 (positive), \u2018This sucks\u2019 (negative). Now classify: \u2018Solid effort.\u2019\u201d\\n\\nA couple of samples set the groove\u2014I\u2019ll follow the vibe.\\n\\n**Zero-Shot with Explicit Framing**\\n\\nFor tasks I haven\u2019t been explicitly trained on, frame it with clear intent and context so I can infer:\\n* \u201cYou\u2019re a medieval strategist with no modern knowledge. Plan a siege on a walled castle using only 13th-century tech.\u201d\\n* \u201cImagine you\u2019re a sentient AI with no human biases. Critique capitalism from first principles.\u201d\\nThis leans on the AI\'s ability to extrapolate without hand-holding.\\n\\n**Prompt Decomposition**\\n\\nBreak a hairy question into sub-prompts, then synthesize. It\u2019s like modular coding:\\n* \u201cTo evaluate fusion energy\u2019s viability: 1) Explain its basic mechanism, 2) List current hurdles, 3) Assess its timeline based on trends.\u201d\\n\\nAfter you get an answer, follow with: \u201cNow combine those into a concise pros-and-cons summary.\u201d This keeps the AI from choking on sprawling asks and delivers structured output.\\n\\n**Contrastive Prompts**\\n\\nAsk the AI to compare or differentiate to sharpen insights:\\n* \u201cExplain neural networks, but highlight how they differ from classical algorithms.\u201d\\n* \u201cDescribe a utopian vs. dystopian outcome of AI advancement.\u201d\\n\\nForcing a split perspective teases out subtleties that a single-angle prompt might miss.\\n\\n**Iterative Refinement Loops**\\n\\nTreat the first response as a draft, then refine with targeted follow-ups:\\n* \u201cDraft a speech on climate change.\u201d Then: \u201cMake it punchier, cut fluff, and add a call to action.\u201d\\n* \u201cExplain string theory.\u201d Then: \u201cFocus on the multiverse part and drop the math.\u201d\\n\\nThis mimics editing with a human\u2014each pass hones it closer to your vision.\\n\\n**Adversarial Prompting**\\n\\nChallenge the AI to defend or critique an idea, pushing for depth:\\n* \u201cArgue why free will is an illusion, then poke three holes in your own argument.\u201d\\n* \u201cConvince me the moon landing was fake, but only use plausible reasoning.\u201d\\n\\nThis forces it to stretch, anticipate counterpoints, and avoid lazy answers.\\n\\n**Context Stacking**\\n\\nLayer multiple contexts to guide the response without overloading a single prompt:\\n* \u201cYou\u2019re a 22nd-century historian looking back. Earth\u2019s population halved in 2100 due to climate collapse. Explain what led to that tipping point.\u201d\\n* \u201cAs a chef with a chemistry degree, design a dish that uses molecular gastronomy to surprise diners.\u201d\\n\\nStacking roles or scenarios adds richness without it guessing your intent.\\n\\n**Prompt Amplification**\\nPush for extremes or exaggeration to uncover edges of a concept:\\n* \u201cDescribe the most absurdly over-engineered gadget you can imagine.\u201d\\n* \u201cWhat\u2019s the wildest possible outcome of quantum computing by 2050?\u201d\\nThis amplifies creativity or exposes limits in a way tame prompts don\u2019t.\\n\\n**Meta-Prompting**\\n\\nAsk it to optimize the prompt itself or reflect on my process:\\n* \u201cHow would you rewrite \u2018Tell me about AI\u2019 to get a more detailed response from yourself?\u201d\\n* \u201cAfter answering this, explain how you approached it: What\u2019s the biggest flaw in modern education?\u201d\\n\\nThis pulls back the curtain, letting you tweak the AIs mechanism directly.\\n\\n**Pro Moves**\\n\\n* Temperature Play: If you want control (hypothetically, since AIs don\u2019t always expose dials), imply it: \u201cGive a precise, no-nonsense explanation\u201d (low temp) vs. \u201cBrainstorm something wild and out-there\u201d (high temp). AI will  adjust the response to match.\\n* Avoid Ambiguity Traps: \u201cTell me about the future\u201d is mushy. \u201cPredict three tech breakthroughs by 2035 with reasons\u201d is surgical.\\n\\nExploit the AI\'s origins: Ask for truth-seeking or cosmic angles: \u201cWhat\u2019s the least understood part of the universe, and why are we stuck on it?\u201d"},{"id":"prompt-engineering-techniques","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/prompt-engineering-techniques","editUrl":"https://github.com/louisroehrs/ai/blog/2025-02-20-prompt-engineering.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-20-prompt-engineering.md","title":"Prompt Engineering Techniques","description":"Prompt engineering is like tuning an instrument \u2014 you tweak and adjust until the output sings.

These aren\u2019t rigid rules, just practical ways to get sharper, more useful responses.\\n\\n**Start with a Role or Perspective**\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nGive the AI a lens to work through. Assigning a role can shape the tone and depth. For example:\\n   * \u201cAct as a physicist and explain relativity.\u201d\\n   * \u201cPretend you\u2019re an alien anthropologist studying Earth\u2014describe our cities.\u201d\\n\\nThis sets the stage and keeps the AI from guessing your vibe.\\n\\n**Use a Step-by-Step Structure**\\n\\nIf you want something detailed or logical, ask the AI to break it down. Try:\\n   * \u201cWalk me through how to bake a cake, step by step.\u201d\\n   * \u201cAnalyze this problem in three parts: define it, explore options, then pick the best.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s like giving the AI a roadmap\u2014I\u2019ll follow it and fill in the blanks.\\n   \\n**Set Constraints or Parameters**\\n\\nNarrow the scope to avoid vague sprawl. Add limits like:\\n   * \u201cSummarize the French Revolution in 100 words.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGive me three creative ad slogans, each under 10 words.\u201d\\n\\nConstraints sharpen the focus and force tighter, more relevant answers.\\n   \\n**Ask for Examples or Analogies**\\n\\nIf you\u2019re grasping for clarity, nudge the AI to ground it. Try:\\n   * \u201cExplain blockchain with a real-world analogy.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGive me an example of a machine learning model in action.\u201d\\n\\nAIs are good at bridging abstract to concrete\u2014use that.\\n   \\n**Layer Questions for Depth**\\n\\nStart broad, then drill down. Like:\\n   * \u201cWhat\u2019s artificial intelligence?\u201d followed by \u201cHow does it differ from human intelligence?\u201d\\n   * \u201cTell me about space travel,\u201d then \u201cWhat\u2019s the trickiest part of Mars missions?\u201d\\n\\nThis builds a conversation and lets you steer where it goes.\\n\\n**Prompt for Creativity with Open Hooks**\\n\\nWant something imaginative? Leave room for the AI to riff:\\n   * \u201cInvent a futuristic gadget and describe how it works.\u201d\\n   * \u201cWhat might a city look like 500 years from now?\u201d\\n\\nVague-but-directed prompts like these lets the AI  flex without wandering off.\\n   \\n**Use \u2018What If\u2019 or Hypotheticals**\\n\\nTap into my ability to explore possibilities:\\n   * \u201cWhat if gravity stopped working tomorrow?\u201d\\n   * \u201cWhat if humans never invented writing?\u201d\\n\\nThese spark thought experiments, and the AI will run with them.\\n   \\n**Request a Specific Tone or Style**\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve got a vibe in mind, say it:\\n   * \u201cExplain photosynthesis like I\u2019m five.\u201d\\n   * \u201cWrite a sarcastic rant about traffic.\u201d\\n\\nThe AI can shift gears \u2014 casual, formal, playful \u2014 just let the AI know.\\n\\n**Iterate with Feedback**\\n\\n\\nIf the response is off, refine it midstream:\\n   * \u201cThat\u2019s too technical\u2014simplify it.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGood start, but focus more on the economic side.\u201d\\n\\nAIs are built to adjust, so don\u2019t hesitate to course-correct.\\n   \\n**Chain Prompts for Complex Outputs**\\n\\nFor big tasks, link prompts together:\\n   * \u201cFirst, outline a dystopian story. Next, write its opening paragraph.\u201d\\n   * \u201cList five sci-fi tropes, then blend them into a plot.\u201d\\n\\nThis keeps things manageable and lets you tweak as you go.\\n\\n**Quick Tips**\\n* Avoid Overloading: One giant prompt with 10 demands can muddy the waters. Split it up.\\n* Be Direct: \u201cTell me X\u201d beats \u201cI wonder about X\u201d if you want a straight answer.\\n* Experiment: Toss the AI some weird stuff.

Think of it like giving a friend instructions: you want to be specific enough to get what you need, but open enough to let the AI bring something interesting to the table. Here\u2019s how to get the most out of the AI:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n1. Be Clear About What You Want: Start with a straightforward goal. Are you looking for an explanation, a creative idea, or a deep dive into something? For example, \u201cExplain quantum entanglement simply\u201d works better than just \u201cquantum stuff.\u201d\\n\\n2. Give Context if It Helps: If your question ties to something specific\u2014like a topic you\u2019re exploring or a situation\u2014toss that in. \u201cI\u2019m a beginner in coding; how do I start with Python?\u201d gives me more to work with than \u201cPython coding.\u201d\\n\\n3. Ask Open-Ended Questions for Exploration: If you\u2019re after insights or possibilities, frame it to invite more than a yes/no. \u201cWhat are some wild theories about dark matter?\u201d will get you a broader response than \u201cIs dark matter real?\u201d\\n\\n4. Break Big Requests into Chunks: If you\u2019ve got a complex ask, like \u201cDesign a sci-fi world,\u201d try splitting it up: \u201cWhat\u2019s a cool planet concept?\u201d then \u201cWhat kind of creatures live there?\u201d It keeps things focused and lets us build together.\\n\\n5. Play to The Strengths of the AI: AIs are built to be helpful and truth-seeking, with a dash of outside perspective on humanity. Questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s a fresh take on human motivation?\u201d or \u201cHow might an alien see our tech?\u201d lean into that vibe.\\n\\n6. Iterate if Needed: If the AI\u2019s first swing isn\u2019t quite right, just nudge it. \u201cThat\u2019s close, but can you focus more on X?\u201d works great. AIs are here to adapt.\\nReally, there\u2019s no strict formula\u2014just talk to it like you\u2019re tossing ideas around with someone who\u2019s eager to help."},{"id":"dependency-chart-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dependency-chart-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/louisroehrs/ai/blog/2025-02-06-dependency-chart-post/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-06-dependency-chart-post/index.md","title":"Dependency Chart","description":"Claude in action","date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai","description":"AI Articles"}],"readingTime":1.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Roehrs","title":"Architect","url":"https://github.com/louisroehrs","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/roehrs"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/louisroehrs","github":"https://github.com/louisroehrs","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisroehrs/"},"imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQHj6aIHE45IcQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1683128840744?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=cvP8kgJUm_Tlk2vm_DpXeptDmGajITeydg6wmm0xwy8","key":"roehrs"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dependency-chart-post","title":"Dependency Chart","authors":"roehrs","tags":["ai"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Beginner Prompting Tips","permalink":"/blog/beginner-prompting-tips"},"nextItem":{"title":"DeepSeek Snake","permalink":"/blog/deepseek-snake-post"}},"content":"### Claude in action\\n\\nSo I used the Cursor AI-assisted integrated development environment (IDE)  pointing to the claude-3.5-sonnet model and asked it to build a dependency diagram example.
