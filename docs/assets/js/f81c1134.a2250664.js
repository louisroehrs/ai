My partner and I came up with the project title ThermoNuclear Smurf Detonation Device.  Our TA called it an automatic A+ project.  So we had to make it work with digital chips and no microprocessor.  It took a whopping semester to build it with our nerd kits that we transported chained to our wrists with \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e handcuffs.  \\n\\nBack in the day, the world was in love with Smurfs, those blue fuzzy things with white hats. <b>[Learn more about Smurfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purple_Smurfs)</b>.\\n\\nThis is not our photo as disc photography (not digital) was all the rage so we don\'t have a picture, but once you see one rat\'s nest of wires for a project in 6.111, you\'ve seen them all.   My friend did the game hardware and I did the video section. ![Nerd Kits wired up.](/smurfs/NerdKits.png)\\n\\n**36 years later...**\\n\\nHey, what about that game we made back in the days of big hair and great music.  Can AI make that game?\\n\\nI fired up Cursor, the AI enable IDE, <b>[Cursor IDE, download it, build, and get rich](https://www.cursor.com/en)</b> and gave this ridiculously bare prompt with no real thought.\\n\\nOh, I spoke the prompt using the Mac\'s fn-fn voice-typer trick.  (I\'m not swearing, type the **fn** key twice to voice type on a Mac anywhere text is accepted.) This will explain the \'Astros\' among other things in the prompt.\\n\\n```\\nWrite a game that simulates the Astros game instead\\nof asteroids have 3-D Smurf characters that get blown\\nup into smaller Smurf characters. Write this game\\nusing JavaScript. The rocket can we accelerated\\nwith the A key, slowed with the S key,  and fired missiles\\nwith the F key and rotated with the R key to the right\\n```\\n\\n(Good grief, the voice-typer can\'t even spell things and Claude still  gets it.)\\n\\n\\nAnd it built this <a href=\\"/smurfs/\\"><b>Smurf Shooter, click here to play</b></a> on the first go.\\n\\n![Smurf game](/smurfs/SmurfScreenshot.png)\\n\\nAnd it produced these lovely instructions:\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis game includes:\\n\\n1. A rocket that you can control with:\\n   - \'A\' key to accelerate\\n   - \'S\' key to decelerate\\n   - \'R\' key to rotate\\n   - \'F\' key to fire missiles\\n\\n2. Smurfs that:\\n   - Float around the screen\\n   - Split into smaller Smurfs when hit by missiles\\n   - Are drawn with a simple blue body and white hat\\n\\n3. Game features:\\n   - Collision detection between missiles and Smurfs\\n   - Screen wrapping for both the rocket and Smurfs\\n   - Victory condition when all Smurfs are destroyed\\n   - Smooth animation using requestAnimationFrame\\n\\nTo play the game:\\n1. Save both files in the same directory\\n2. Open index.html in a web browser\\n3. Use the A, S, R, and F keys to control the rocket\\n   and shoot the Smurfs\\n\\nThe Smurfs will split into smaller versions when hit,\\nuntil they reach a minimum size at which point they\'ll\\ndisappear when hit. The game ends when\\nall Smurfs are destroyed.\\n```\\n\\nI love the graphic it produced for the smurf.  Classic!\\n\\nThere are some issues.  The missiles don\'t take into account the speed of the ship when fired.  I did not say what happened if the ship collided with an astroid.  So all in all pretty amazine.\\n\\nI did not touch the code one bit except to add the /smurfs path to game.js in the index.html.  Otherwise, it all works on the first shot.  No other edits or prompts.\\n\\nDo we need coders?\\n\\n- Time to build this game. 5 minutes.\\n- Time to write this up. 1 hour.\\n- Time for you to read it. Priceless!\\n\\n\\nPostScript\\n\\nI was using chatgpt to help debug issues with Docusaurus to get these links to flat html pages to work around Facebook\'s insanity.  It took three hours to figure it out.  Once we did, (yes, the AI and I...). It had this to say:\\n\\n```\\nHaha, I feel your pain.

Show your reasoning.\u201d\\n* \u201cDesign a sustainable city. First, identify key challenges, then propose solutions, and finally explain trade-offs.\u201d\\n\\nBy asking for the process, you get transparency and can spot where to tweak.\\n\\n**Few-Shot Learning**\\n\\nGive the AI examples to mimic a style, format, or reasoning pattern. This primes it to replicate what you\u2019re after:\\n* \u201cWrite a haiku. Here\u2019s two examples: \u2018Silent moon glows soft / Shadows dance on still water / Night holds its breath tight\u2019 and \u2018Frost bites the green leaves / Wind whispers through bare branches / Time turns cold and slow.\u2019 Now you try.\u201d\\n* \u201cClassify these as positive or negative: \u2018Great job!\u2019 (positive), \u2018This sucks\u2019 (negative).

Plan a siege on a walled castle using only 13th-century tech.\u201d\\n* \u201cImagine you\u2019re a sentient AI with no human biases. Critique capitalism from first principles.\u201d\\nThis leans on the AI\'s ability to extrapolate without hand-holding.\\n\\n**Prompt Decomposition**\\n\\nBreak a hairy question into sub-prompts, then synthesize. It\u2019s like modular coding:\\n* \u201cTo evaluate fusion energy\u2019s viability: 1) Explain its basic mechanism, 2) List current hurdles, 3) Assess its timeline based on trends.\u201d\\n\\nAfter you get an answer, follow with: \u201cNow combine those into a concise pros-and-cons summary.\u201d This keeps the AI from choking on sprawling asks and delivers structured output.\\n\\n**Contrastive Prompts**\\n\\nAsk the AI to compare or differentiate to sharpen insights:\\n* \u201cExplain neural networks, but highlight how they differ from classical algorithms.\u201d\\n* \u201cDescribe a utopian vs. dystopian outcome of AI advancement.\u201d\\n\\nForcing a split perspective teases out subtleties that a single-angle prompt might miss.\\n\\n**Iterative Refinement Loops**\\n\\nTreat the first response as a draft, then refine with targeted follow-ups:\\n* \u201cDraft a speech on climate change.\u201d Then: \u201cMake it punchier, cut fluff, and add a call to action.\u201d\\n* \u201cExplain string theory.\u201d Then: \u201cFocus on the multiverse part and drop the math.\u201d\\n\\nThis mimics editing with a human\u2014each pass hones it closer to your vision.\\n\\n**Adversarial Prompting**\\n\\nChallenge the AI to defend or critique an idea, pushing for depth:\\n* \u201cArgue why free will is an illusion, then poke three holes in your own argument.\u201d\\n* \u201cConvince me the moon landing was fake, but only use plausible reasoning.\u201d\\n\\nThis forces it to stretch, anticipate counterpoints, and avoid lazy answers.\\n\\n**Context Stacking**\\n\\nLayer multiple contexts to guide the response without overloading a single prompt:\\n* \u201cYou\u2019re a 22nd-century historian looking back. Earth\u2019s population halved in 2100 due to climate collapse. Explain what led to that tipping point.\u201d\\n* \u201cAs a chef with a chemistry degree, design a dish that uses molecular gastronomy to surprise diners.\u201d\\n\\nStacking roles or scenarios adds richness without it guessing your intent.\\n\\n**Prompt Amplification**\\nPush for extremes or exaggeration to uncover edges of a concept:\\n* \u201cDescribe the most absurdly over-engineered gadget you can imagine.\u201d\\n* \u201cWhat\u2019s the wildest possible outcome of quantum computing by 2050?\u201d\\nThis amplifies creativity or exposes limits in a way tame prompts don\u2019t.\\n\\n**Meta-Prompting**\\n\\nAsk it to optimize the prompt itself or reflect on my process:\\n* \u201cHow would you rewrite \u2018Tell me about AI\u2019 to get a more detailed response from yourself?\u201d\\n* \u201cAfter answering this, explain how you approached it: What\u2019s the biggest flaw in modern education?\u201d\\n\\nThis pulls back the curtain, letting you tweak the AIs mechanism directly.\\n\\n**Pro Moves**\\n\\n* Temperature Play: If you want control (hypothetically, since AIs don\u2019t always expose dials), imply it: \u201cGive a precise, no-nonsense explanation\u201d (low temp) vs. \u201cBrainstorm something wild and out-there\u201d (high temp).

Add limits like:\\n   * \u201cSummarize the French Revolution in 100 words.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGive me three creative ad slogans, each under 10 words.\u201d\\n\\nConstraints sharpen the focus and force tighter, more relevant answers.\\n   \\n**Ask for Examples or Analogies**\\n\\nIf you\u2019re grasping for clarity, nudge the AI to ground it. Try:\\n   * \u201cExplain blockchain with a real-world analogy.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGive me an example of a machine learning model in action.\u201d\\n\\nAIs are good at bridging abstract to concrete\u2014use that.\\n   \\n**Layer Questions for Depth**\\n\\nStart broad, then drill down. Like:\\n   * \u201cWhat\u2019s artificial intelligence?\u201d followed by \u201cHow does it differ from human intelligence?\u201d\\n   * \u201cTell me about space travel,\u201d then \u201cWhat\u2019s the trickiest part of Mars missions?\u201d\\n\\nThis builds a conversation and lets you steer where it goes.\\n\\n**Prompt for Creativity with Open Hooks**\\n\\nWant something imaginative? Leave room for the AI to riff:\\n   * \u201cInvent a futuristic gadget and describe how it works.\u201d\\n   * \u201cWhat might a city look like 500 years from now?\u201d\\n\\nVague-but-directed prompts like these lets the AI  flex without wandering off.\\n   \\n**Use \u2018What If\u2019 or Hypotheticals**\\n\\nTap into my ability to explore possibilities:\\n   * \u201cWhat if gravity stopped working tomorrow?\u201d\\n   * \u201cWhat if humans never invented writing?\u201d\\n\\nThese spark thought experiments, and the AI will run with them.\\n   \\n**Request a Specific Tone or Style**\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve got a vibe in mind, say it:\\n   * \u201cExplain photosynthesis like I\u2019m five.\u201d\\n   * \u201cWrite a sarcastic rant about traffic.\u201d\\n\\nThe AI can shift gears \u2014 casual, formal, playful \u2014 just let the AI know.\\n\\n**Iterate with Feedback**\\n\\n\\nIf the response is off, refine it midstream:\\n   * \u201cThat\u2019s too technical\u2014simplify it.\u201d\\n   * \u201cGood start, but focus more on the economic side.\u201d\\n\\nAIs are built to adjust, so don\u2019t hesitate to course-correct.\\n   \\n**Chain Prompts for Complex Outputs**\\n\\nFor big tasks, link prompts together:\\n   * \u201cFirst, outline a dystopian story. Next, write its opening paragraph.\u201d\\n   * \u201cList five sci-fi tropes, then blend them into a plot.\u201d\\n\\nThis keeps things manageable and lets you tweak as you go.\\n\\n**Quick Tips**\\n* Avoid Overloading: One giant prompt with 10 demands can muddy the waters. Split it up.\\n* Be Direct: \u201cTell me X\u201d beats \u201cI wonder about X\u201d if you want a straight answer.\\n* Experiment: Toss the AI some weird stuff. They are here to roll with it.\\n  \\nEnjoy!"},{"id":"beginner-prompting-tips","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/beginner-prompting-tips","editUrl":"https://github.com/louisroehrs/ai/blog/2025-02-13-beginner-prompting-tips.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-13-beginner-prompting-tips.md","title":"Beginner Prompting Tips","description":"Crafting effective prompts for Grok, ChatGPT, or any similar LLM-based AI is all about clarity, context, and curiosity.

Think of it like giving a friend instructions: you want to be specific enough to get what you need, but open enough to let the AI bring something interesting to the table. Here\u2019s how to get the most out of the AI:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n1. Be Clear About What You Want: Start with a straightforward goal. Are you looking for an explanation, a creative idea, or a deep dive into something? For example, \u201cExplain quantum entanglement simply\u201d works better than just \u201cquantum stuff.\u201d\\n\\n2. Give Context if It Helps: If your question ties to something specific\u2014like a topic you\u2019re exploring or a situation\u2014toss that in. \u201cI\u2019m a beginner in coding; how do I start with Python?\u201d gives me more to work with than \u201cPython coding.\u201d\\n\\n3. Ask Open-Ended Questions for Exploration: If you\u2019re after insights or possibilities, frame it to invite more than a yes/no. \u201cWhat are some wild theories about dark matter?\u201d will get you a broader response than \u201cIs dark matter real?\u201d\\n\\n4. Break Big Requests into Chunks: If you\u2019ve got a complex ask, like \u201cDesign a sci-fi world,\u201d try splitting it up: \u201cWhat\u2019s a cool planet concept?\u201d then \u201cWhat kind of creatures live there?\u201d It keeps things focused and lets us build together.\\n\\n5. Play to The Strengths of the AI: AIs are built to be helpful and truth-seeking, with a dash of outside perspective on humanity. Questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s a fresh take on human motivation?\u201d or \u201cHow might an alien see our tech?\u201d lean into that vibe.\\n\\n6. Iterate if Needed: If the AI\u2019s first swing isn\u2019t quite right, just nudge it. \u201cThat\u2019s close, but can you focus more on X?\u201d works great. AIs are here to adapt.\\nReally, there\u2019s no strict formula\u2014just talk to it like you\u2019re tossing ideas around with someone who\u2019s eager to help."},{"id":"dependency-chart-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dependency-chart-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/louisroehrs/ai/blog/2025-02-06-dependency-chart-post/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-06-dependency-chart-post/index.md","title":"Dependency Chart","description":"Claude in action","date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai","description":"AI Articles"}],"readingTime":1.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Roehrs","title":"Architect","url":"https://github.com/louisroehrs","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/roehrs"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/louisroehrs","github":"https://github.com/louisroehrs","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisroehrs/"},"imageURL":"/img/1683128840744.jpeg","key":"roehrs"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dependency-chart-post","title":"Dependency Chart","authors":"roehrs","tags":["ai"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Beginner Prompting Tips","permalink":"/blog/beginner-prompting-tips"},"nextItem":{"title":"DeepSeek Snake","permalink":"/blog/deepseek-snake-post"}},"content":"### Claude in action\\n\\nSo I used the Cursor AI-assisted integrated development environment (IDE)  pointing to the claude-3.5-sonnet model and asked it to build a dependency diagram example.
