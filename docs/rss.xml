                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided to see how well DeepSeek writes a basic snake game in JavaScript.   While it understood the concept well with a minimum of prompting, it didn&rsquo;t do as well with the code even though it provided the following instructions once it finished coding.</p>
<p>First, the game didn&rsquo;t run at all.  Variable scoping was confused with variables in functions referring to those in other functions as if they were global.  To get the game to run, I made those variables global.</p>
<p>It was not very familiar with the ctx and HTML canvas API, applying size attributes on the wrong element and hallucinating some non-existent API calls to get the canvas size.  I changed the code to set the canvas size to a given x,y size scaled by a settable scale.</p>
<p>It was also referring to the canvas width and height as strings and trying to do math with them.  Removed quotes to fix those instances.</p>
<p>It completely failed to put in event handling code for the key presses.  I added that.</p>
<p>It stopped when it found food.  I fixed that as well.</p>
<p>A neat feature that it did add which worked right away was that the snake grew with alternating color segments.</p>
<p>Collision with itself was not discussed and not coded.</p>
<p>Anyhow, enjoy!</p>
<p>The game is simple but demonstrates basic game mechanics and controls in JavaScript.</p>
